### The Age of large rockets

Since the launch of the first satellite by Russia on 4 October 1957, the Sputnik, thousands of satellites, large and small, have been launched. As of February 8, 2022, according to [Earthsky.org](https://Earthsky.org)<sup>1</sup> there are around 4,550 satellites orbiting the earth—3,790 in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), 139 in Medium Earth Orbit, and the others at higher orbits. Till recently the rockets and correspondingly the payloads they launched were huge; among the payloads were the Apollo Moon Landers, the International Space Station, the Hubble and Webb telescopes, the Mars Lander and so on. A partial list of currently active large rockets includes:

|Name|Country|Payload to LEO (kg)|Payload to MEO (kg)|Cost per launch (US$ millions)|Successful launches to date|Since|
|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-|
|Ariane&nbsp;5|European Space Agency|21,000|10,735|165 - 220|108|1996|
|Atlas 5|USA|18,850|8,900|109 - 153|95|2002|
|GSLV III|India|10,000|4,000||3|2014|
|PSLV|India|3,800|1,200||352|1993|
|Proton|Russia|23,000|6,920|65|378|1965|

The currently active large rockets also include the commercial launchers build by the Space X (USA) company.

|Name|Country|Payload to LEO (kg)|Payload to MEO (kg)|Cost per launch (US$ millions)|Successful launches to date|Since|
|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-|
|Falcon 9|Space X, USA|22,800|8,300|61.2|168|2010|
|Falcon Heavy|Space X, USA|63,800|26,700|90 - 150|3|2018|

### The advent of the small rockets

Meanwhile miniaturization of electronics has led to the development of small satellites used for communication and earth observation that are often launched in large numbers referred to as a constellation. Obviously, the cost of launching small satellites on a large rocket is prohibitively expensive. One solution to the problem is to ‘rideshare’ many such small satellites on a large rocket so that they can share the cost of the launch. There are several drawbacks to this approach:

- often the company that made the small satellite may have to wait a long time for a rocket to become full enough to launch, and 
- since the rocket is launching many satellites at one time, the small satellite may not be able to achieve the ideal orbit needed for it to be fully effective.

These problems have led to the development of a burgeoning market for small rockets that can deliver small payloads in a cost-effective manner. 

Small satellites weigh less than 500 kg with most in the 10 – 100 kg range. They are used for communication and remote sensing. Many companies including Space X, Amazon, Bharti Airtel, and Tata are planning to launch constellations of satellites to provide cheap internet coverage world- wide. In the US many start-ups have jumped into this new market opportunity. These include:

- Rocket Lab, the market leader with the Electron rocket that has been successfully launched on a regular basis, with plans to launch up to 1 a week. The company also plans to develop a larger rocket, the Neutron, that can carry 13,000 kg to LEO and can be used to launch constellations of small satellites; it will provide direct competition to Falcon 9, the current market leader in that category; it is scheduled for launch in 2024. Like the Falcon 9, the Neutron will be reusable (including the fairing that protects the satellite during the launch, a feat that the Falcon 9 cannot do thus further reducing the cost per lauch.)
- Astra which can launch 200 kg from many locations. Though it successfully launched a satellite in 2021 it has experienced several subsequent failures which makes its future doubtful.
- Launcher 1 by Virgin Orbit which is unique in not having a first stage but instead launching the rocket from a plane after lifting it to an altitude of 34,000 feet. It has had one successful launch in 2021.
- Terran 1 by Relativity Space. Using a massive 3D printer, they plan to 3D print the rocket as well as the engine; the goal is to minimize cost and maximize rapid, reliable production. They plan to make their first launch in 2022.

Many other companies in the US, Spain, Germany, UK, Japan are working on similar ideas. One of the more unusual plans is for a Spanish company to launch the rocket from a balloon!

### India joins the race

India also has joined the race to develop these small rockets especially since commercial ventures in launch systems and satellite development became possible since 2020. The Indian Government set up the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe) under the Ministry of Atomic Energy and Space. This new organization will regulate and support private companies’ entry into the space market. Over 60 start-ups have registered their interest with ISRO.
